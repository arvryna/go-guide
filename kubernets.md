# Core components: 
Pod, service, ingress, deployment, statefulset, volumes, configmap, secrets

# Installation (Linux)
- Minikube - Suitable for local setup that has one node containing master and workers in the same node, you can run this on top of
  docker runtime or using virtualbox(installation seperate).
  * Starting minikube: `minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox`
  * Start with docker runtime: `minikube start --vm-driver=none`
- Kubectl - command to control the whole k8s cluster. Acts like the main control panel for k8s

# Essential Kubectl commands:
- Setup a new deployment:  `kubectl apply -f ./app.yaml`
  - This sets up everything right from pot to container and also launch the cluster with settings mentioned in app.yaml 
- Create deployment from public docker image (eg, ngnix)
  - `kubectl create deployment mongdb-server --image=mongo` (check the registry image name)
- See all pods: `kubectl get pods`
- Pod details (verbose): `kubectl get pod -o wide`
- Checking logs: `kubectl logs <pod-id>`
- Delete pod: `kubectl delete pods <pod-id> --force` 
- Pod details: `kubectl describe pod <pod-id>`
- Service details: `kubectl describe service <service-id>`
- Delete all pods (caution with force flag): `kubectl delete all --all --all-namespaces --force`
- Check services: `kubectl get services`
- Check deployment: `kubectl get deployment`
- Check all nodes: `kubectl get nodes`
- Editing kubectl deployment: `kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>`
  - upon editing, old pod gets deleted, new pod gets created. And a new replicaset also gets created
- Just like in docker, it is possible to login to the shell of the pod
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod-id> -- bin/bash`

# config.yaml file
