# Collection of standard Go questions that you can expect in an interview


## How to OOP in go ?
- Inheritance:
    - Go doesn't have language support for Inheritance, like the popular "extends" keyword from lang like java
    - But we can simulate the effect by using composition
    - The sample of inheritance and embedding can be found here
- Encapsulation:
    -  Again, go doesn't have special keyword like private, protected etc, like in java/c++
    -  But you can use the Go's visibility feature i.e using Small letters to hide the functions / variables
